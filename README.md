# 📋 Automated Attendance System

## 🚀 Project Overview

The **Automated Attendance System** is designed to streamline attendance tracking using facial recognition technology. This system automates the process of recording attendance, improving efficiency and accuracy in attendance management.

## 🎯 Features

- **Facial Recognition**: Utilizes the Harkescade algorithm for real-time facial recognition and attendance tracking.
- **Data Storage**: Attendance records are stored in a MySQL database for reliable and scalable data management.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Provides real-time monitoring and logging of attendance.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - **OpenCV**: For facial recognition and image processing.
  - **MySQL Connector**: For database interaction.
  - **Tkinter**: For creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **Database**:
  - **MySQL**: For storing attendance records.

## 📁 Project Structure


- `data/`: Contains the dataset and attendance records.
- `src/`: Source code for facial recognition, attendance logging, database management, and GUI.
- `models/`: Saved facial recognition model.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Automated_Attendance_System.git
   cd Automated_Attendance_System
2. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
